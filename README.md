Project Collaborators: Jimmy, Bia, Babar, Whayden

Goal: Make the following improvements to the Chess Assignment
1) Have a UI indicator of whose turn it is (White or Black)
2) Have a UI indicator of whether or not an attempted move is illegal (placing the piece in original position if it is)
3) Have a UI indicator of recommended moves a player can take (greedy -- recommends moves, if any, that can take opponent pieces)
4) Agent you can play against (choosing random moves)
